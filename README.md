# LinkedIn-Unfollowers

It finds out who **unfollowers** are in [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/) at once.

If you value the **FFF**[^1] act? Then check this out!

P.S. This is my first webcrawl trial with selenium for _1/4 day_ in total.

> **Precautions**: Remove **'.example'** from the filename of `.env` and clear the comment in it.

[^1]: FFF means _"follow-for-follow"_.
